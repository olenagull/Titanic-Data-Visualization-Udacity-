        <h1>Titanic <span id="Survivors">Survivors</span> and <span id="Dead">Dead</span> by Age Group and Passenger Class</h1>
        <p>The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.</p>
        
        <p>One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. As seen from the graph, more first-class passengers survived rather that third-class ones. It is also noticeable that majority of first-class people belong to older age group compare to third-class where we see more younger ones.</p>
