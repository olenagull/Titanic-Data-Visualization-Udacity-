# Data Visualisation with Dimple.js 
Final Project for Udacity Nano Degree

## Summary

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Only 31,6% of people who survived the sinking. 
The goal of this project is to visualize what sorts of people were likely to survive.



## Design

The original data set is already cleaned. I only grouped age into categories and mapped survivers vs. died people. 

Since my data does not have any values except counts, my first decision is to show the percentage of Survived vs. Perished people by the passenger calss on a 100% stacked plot. 
Small animation is added while loading the chart. 

- x axis shows the survival status
- y axis shows the percentage of the passengers in each status
- The color shows the passenger class

The first design is shown in the screenshot:
